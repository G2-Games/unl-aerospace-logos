# UNL Aerospace Logos
Logos I've created for the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln Aerospace Club.

Ownership of this repository will be transfered to the club if/when requested.

The logos in `.svg` format in this repository are intended to be opened using the wonderful [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) editor, although they should also function if opened in other software.
